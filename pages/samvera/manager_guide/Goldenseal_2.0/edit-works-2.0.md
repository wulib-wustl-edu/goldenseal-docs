# Editing a Work

There are two views for works: Browse view and Edit view. The public-facing view of a work is the Browse view. A user will navigate to a work and then click “Edit” to access the edit view. As an admin user, you would be able to edit any work in the repository.

In the edit view for a work, you can change the description, add files, edit sharing, and edit visibility. If you edit any of these settings, you must click “Save” in order to apply your changes. Note that if you add files, you must recheck the deposit agreement before saving.

If you edit the sharing or visibility of the work, you can either opt to have all files in the work inherit these permissions, or you can opt to have the individual files retain their permissions so that they can be edited manually.

## Editing a file
