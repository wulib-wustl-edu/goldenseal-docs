## View Your Collections

To view your collections, navigate to the Dashboard, then click “My Collections” in the dropdown dashboard menu.

To create a new collection:
- Click the "+" dropdown menu. At the bottom of the menu, click either "Administrative" or "Personal" under the "Add a Collection" heading

You can only set visibility and sharing AFTER the collection is created.

## Adding Works to Collections

There are several ways to add works to collections:

- From the Dashboard, click “My Works”. Click the "Select an action" dropdown menu and click “Add to Collection”. To add the works to an existing collection, select the collection in the dialog box, then click “Save Changes.”

The visibility of a collection does not affect the visibility of a work. For example, if an Open Access work is added to a Private collection, the work will remain Open Access, but a link to the collection itself can not be discovered.

## Editing Collections

- To edit metadata for a collection, click on the “My Collections” link in the Dashboard and click on the "Select an action" dropdown menu.  Click the “Edit” button in the dropdown menu.
- Collections can be either public, limited to institution only, or private.
- To remove works from a collection, click on the “My Collections” link in the Dashboard and click on the collection. Navigate to the “My Works” heading. Click “Remove” next to the work that you would like to delete.
- To delete a collection, click on the “My Collections” link in the Dashboard. Select “Delete Collection” from the “Select an action” dropdown menu next to the collection that you would like to delete.
